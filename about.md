### More Information

No... really... I am a programmer, I am interested in hacking, security, UNIX, Operating Systems, XNU and Mach.

I like Linux. I have hard feelings for Windows. (Fucking Updates).

### Nickname etymology 
<b>GeoSn0w</b>

Geo - Represents short for "George", my real name.

Sn0w - A common suffix used by developers in the pre-iOS 7 Jailbreak community for their utilities or their nicknames. It is almost like a magic from a header, helping someone to place you in the right category by your nickname alone (iOS Development / Jailbreaking).

### Disambiguation
Some people believe I took <code class="high">geo</code> from a famous iOS Hacker, George Hotz who goes by the name <code class="high">geohot</code>. It is not true. As explained previously, <code class="high">geo</code> is short for George. It just happens both me and Hotz have the same name. 

Others believe I took <code class="high">Sn0w</code> from another iOS developer, <code class="high">iH8Sn0w</code>. Again, untrue. He took it from the same place I took it, where it was originally used: <code class="high">UltraSn0w</code> - an iOS unlock payload from back in the days
